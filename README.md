ASG1 NewJeans Website
My website for Assignment One aims to help NewJeans fans find out more about the band and their background. It is a simplified website with a friendly user interface and smooth interactions so that users can have intuitive navigation. My website includes various features, and redirects NewJeans fans to their official website.



Design Process
This website's target audience is NewJean's fans and people who are interested to know NewJeans. 
As a user, I would want to be able to navigate the website easily so I can have good user experience

Features
There are several features in this website 
1) Navigation bar
I provided a navigation bar so that users can easily navigate in the website. Each heading in the navbar will bring the user to the respective pages
2) Music
In the music section, I have provided embedded playlists of NewJean's top hits.
This is so that fans or people interested can get to know them better.
3) Store
In the store section, I have created an image slideshow with various versions of their different EPs of different albums. When clicked on, it brings users to the actual official Newjeans page so that they can conveniently buy their merch if they want to.
4) Tours
In the tour section, I have provided brief information about each tour that they had or are having soon. This gives information for users who want to see their concerts
5) Footer
I have provided NewJeans social media in the footer below. The logos are obvious to see and will let users easily find their social media.

Existing Features
Feature 1 - allows users X to achieve Y, by having them fill out Z

In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:

Features Left to Implement
For my nextr update of this website, I would like to add in a feature that allows the system to send out newsletters to Newjeans fan. Secondly, I would want to put captions for their store items so that users can have more information about the product without clicking on the official website page. Lastly, I would like to make the tours section more detailed and convenient so that users can directly click on the poster link to go to the ticketing website.

Technologies Used
HTML - I used HTML to do the skeleton of the website
CSS - I used CSS to add in colours and small animations
Javascript - I used Javascript for slideshows and smoother scrolling


Unfixed bugs
1) My image slideshow only works after I click a button ( there are no initial images shown before clicking)
2) The website is not fully responsive as there will be an x axis scrollbar once minimised.
